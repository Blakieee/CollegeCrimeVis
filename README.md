We are students at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**, where this project was developed as part of our exploration into data visualization, storytelling, and campus safety analysis.

## Visual and Artistic Reference
This project draws inspiration from the visual and artistic storytelling methods presented in [Crime: The Series](https://www.crimetheseries.com/). The series' emphasis on visually compelling narratives and data-driven insights serves as a foundation for our approach to presenting campus crime data.

## Project Overview
Campus safety is a priority for students, parents, and institutions alike. Our project uses data visualization to analyze campus crime trends, uncover patterns, and suggest actionable insights for creating safer learning environments. By leveraging visual techniques inspired by cinematic storytelling, we aim to engage audiences while delivering meaningful data-driven narratives.
